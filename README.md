# Coin's World
This is my first HTML website. I created it at the starting of my Coding Journey.
At first of 2024, I didn't know coding. So, I started coding by learning ***HTML*** and ***CSS***. After doing some small projects, I started to do this project. **My main goal was to include all the coins from the world.** I included some of them by their links. Though it is not possible to include all coin images, it is a showcase of my skills from that time. I also applied a bit of CSS and JS there. I have to search a lot for the good quality coin image. Also, I had need to check the coin's validity if it was real or fantasy. With much hardworking, I included many images. I also created a logo for the site in Adobe Illustrator. I only added **Bangladesh** and **British India** coins. That was a golden time for me and my coding. Really, I can go to past by seeing my project. So, I want to showcase it perfectly. I want to protect my past memory.
