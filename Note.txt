My first website. 

Note that some files are added later for the suitability of deployment and favicon.
The foure HTML files are native here, they are created first. But the vercel.json, Readme.md, favicon.svg and Note.txt (current file) are added later.

Their purposes: 

Readme.md    -  For uploading the project in Github
favicon.svg  -  This is for the website's favicon. This icon was created when I started this project, but was not                          connected then
vercel.json  -  For deploying in Vercel
Note.txt     -  To inform this informations to you :)
